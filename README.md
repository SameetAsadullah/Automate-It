# Automate_It
The project that we have built is, a home automation system. The system will be responsible for controlling some features of home appliances not just by an android app but also with urdu voice which can be heard either from the app or the microphone device installed. Turning appliances on or off, changing the AC temperature, changing TV channels or playing the next/previous song. This all would be controlled by your voice or using the app.

Manual:
1) Run the automate_it_server folder using command "go run main.go models.go eps.go"
2) Run the react native applicaiton using command "npx react-native run-android"
3) Register by providing ur credentials
4) Log in with those credentials
5) There you can select "Your Home" and play the appliances as you want
6) If you click on "Microphone Input" page then you can send a voice command using microphone
7) If you click on "Set Channels" page then you can set channels numbers according to your television

Note: You will need a professional to set up all the hardware connections. However, you can run the backend server named as "server" in "Hardware Codes" Folder. The command that you will need to run is simply "python3 server.py".
